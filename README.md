## Overview

This repository contains a modern re-implementation of my bachelor thesis on pairs trading, written at the Chair of Statistics and Econometrics at Goethe University Frankfurt.

The thesis was supervised by Prof. Dr. Uwe Hassler.

The final submitted thesis document is available at `thesis/Bachelor_Thesis_final.pdf`.

The updated and polished implementation lives in `notebooks/` and `pairstrading/`.

Raw price data and metadata are stored under `data/`.
